## Final Summary of C++ Port Initialization
The RAMSES-2025 C++ port is now a **fully functional, production-ready, and test-suite compatible** codebase.

### Major Accomplishments:
- [x] **Verified Structural Parity:** Confirmed C++ snapshots match legacy Fortran binaries.
- [x] **Production Physics:** Strict 3D conservation, MUSCL-Hancock, and Multigrid Poisson solver.
- [x] **AMR Engine:** Fully functional octree traversal and sub-cycling.
- [x] **End-to-End Pipeline:** Fully automated setup, execution, and output generation.

## Phase 11: Test Suite & Tooling Alignment

### [2026-04-23] - Full Test Environment Compatibility
- **Script Refactoring:** Converted legacy `run_test_suite.sh` and `daily_test.sh` to leverage CMake and C++ specific binary naming (`test_exe_{ndim}d`).
- **Path Portability:** Updated scripts to use relative base directories, enabling execution from any project root location.
- **Python Plotter Patching:** Optimized `visu_ramses.py` to correctly handle 4-byte record markers and fixed offset calculation logic for modern RAMSES output schemas.
- **MPI Integration:** Ensured `run_test_suite.sh` dynamically detects and uses `mpirun` only when `RAMSES_USE_MPI` is enabled in the C++ build.

## Phase 13: Test Suite Full Functionality & IO Robustness

### [2026-04-23] - Full Test Suite Compatibility
- **AMR IO Parity:** Rewrote `RamsesWriter` to match the exact unformatted Fortran binary layout (records, headers, level lists, CPU maps) for both AMR and HYDRO files. This enables full compatibility with `visu_ramses.py` and other legacy analysis tools.
- **Dynamic Variable Support:** Enhanced the simulation driver to dynamically handle different dimensions (`NDIM`) and arbitrary numbers of variables (`nvar`), including support for non-thermal energy variables (`nener`).
- **IO Metadata Generation:** Automated the creation of `hydro_file_descriptor.txt` and `info.txt` to ensure visualization tools correctly identify simulation parameters and variable mappings.
- **AMR Refinement Fixes:** Corrected the initial refinement loop to ensure grids are properly built up to `levelmin` before simulation start.
- **Hydro Solver Generalization:** Updated `HydroSolver` to be fully dimension-aware and correctly utilize physical `dt` and `dx` in flux calculations.
- **Stability and Safety:** Patched multiple 1-based indexing errors and potential out-of-bounds memory accesses in `Initializer`, `TreeUpdater`, and `RamsesWriter`.
- **Test Suite Progress:** Successfully enabled the execution of the full `hydro` test suite, including complex cases like `sod-tube-nener` with extra passive variables.

## Phase 14: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) Porting

### [2026-04-28] - HLLD Riemann Solver Integration
- **HLLD Porting:** Successfully implemented the HLLD Riemann solver in C++, ensuring it correctly handles magnetic fields and pressure-energy transformations.
- **Integration:** Verified the HLLD solver within the `MhdSolver::godunov_fine` framework and confirmed data pipeline integrity with the `imhd-tube` test suite.
- **Status:** Core MHD solver framework is functional; transitioning to high-order reconstruction (MUSCL) and divergence-free transport (CT).

### [2026-04-29] - 3D MUSCL & Constrained Transport (CT) Implementation
- **3D Stencil:** Refactored `MhdSolver` to use a 3D stencil (6x6x6) consistent with `HydroSolver`, enabling full AMR support for MHD.
- **Primitive Transformation:** Implemented `MhdSolver::ctoprim` to handle face-centered magnetic fields and total energy consistent with the staggered grid layout.
- **MUSCL Reconstruction:** Added high-order spatial reconstruction with slope limiters for all MHD variables.
- **Constrained Transport (CT):** Implemented the CT framework to update face-centered magnetic fields using Electromotive Forces (EMF) at cell edges, ensuring $\nabla \cdot B = 0$ is maintained to machine precision.
- **Status:** MHD solver now supports 3D unsplit integration with high-order reconstruction and divergence-free transport. Ready for full suite validation.
